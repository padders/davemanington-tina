Dave released a new track this week written and recorded remotely over the past few months. Featuring sterling contributions on Drums by Jon Scott and Saxes/Clarinet/Piano/Accordian by Ivo Neame who also mixed the track in his fantastic new home studio. The track is titled "Strike the Harp" and is available on bandcamp. More tracks to follow later this year.
