Recorded remotely in lockdown, this track was written for a group of like-minded London jazz musicians brought together by Rick Simpson to rehearse and workshop each others new music for medium/large jazz ensemble. With the sessions out of action during lockdown, I decided to ask everyone to track their parts at home and put this recording together myself. Everyone did a fantastic job creating the vibe and contributing to a very organic sounding finished track which features great solos from Tommy Andrews on Alto and Billy Marrows on Guitar. credits released March 5, 2021 Dave Manington - Composition and Double Bass Brigitte Beraha - Vocals Freddie Gavita - Trumpet Sean Gibbs - Trumpet Tommy Andrews - Alto Sax George Crowley - Tenor Sax Billy Marrows - Guitar Rick Simpson - Piano Dave Hamblett - Drums  Mixed by Dave Manington and Alex Bonney Mastered by Alex Bonney Artwork by James Manington
