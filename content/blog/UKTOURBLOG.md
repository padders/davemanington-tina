Hi everyone
I'm chuffed to bits to announce these tour dates with my band Riff Raff for this autumn. We're very grateful to Help Musicians UK for helping to fund these gigs and making it possible for me to get some new music out into the world for the first time in a while. I'm excited to play a load of new tunes with the brilliant humans - Brigitte Beraha,  Ivo Neame,  Tom Challenger,  Rob Updegraff and Tim Giles.
Dates are
Friday 29th Sept - The Vortex, LONDON
Thurs 5th Oct - Soundcellar, POOLE
Friday 6th Oct - Calstock Arts, Cornwall
Weds 8th Nov - Lescar, SHEFFIELD
Thurs 9th Nov - The Globe, NEWCASTLE
