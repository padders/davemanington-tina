Weightless

Dave Manington’s Riff RaffRelease Date: 14 February 2025Label: Lamplight Social Records

Lamplight Social Records is proud to announce the release of Weightless, the latest offering from Dave Manington’s Riff Raff, a band at the forefront of contemporary UK jazz. This is a project that thrives on connection, curiosity, and musical exploration, featuring six of the most inventive voices in the scene today:

* Brigitte Beraha – Vocals/Co-composer
* Tomas Challenger – Tenor Saxophone
* Ivo Neame – Piano, Keyboards
* Rob Updegraff – Guitar
* Dave Manington – Double Bass
* Tim Giles – Drums

Over a decade of collaboration has refined Riff Raff into a tightly woven ensemble. Their music combines intricate composition with dynamic improvisation, creating moments that range from delicate and lyrical to raw and electrifying. Weightless is a testament to this chemistry, blending poignant melodies, richly textured harmonies, and rhythmic fluidity.

Manington’s compositions delve into themes of freedom, isolation, and transformation. The title track evokes the awe and uncertainty of drifting through space, while pieces like Strike the Harp and River Swim are steeped in personal reflection and vivid imagery. Brigitte Beraha’s lyrics and improvisational artistry add another layer of depth, shining throughout the album.

The brilliance of Manington's Riff Raff has been widely celebrated by critics: 

“Inventive, forward-looking jazz that subtly pushes the envelope whilst remaining thoroughly accessible.” – Jazzmann

“It grooves like hell, with thick mercurial riffs full of stops, starts, and turns, yet rocking with a savage momentum.” – Jazzwise

“A soaring melody or electric atmosphere is never far away.” – Mike Collins
