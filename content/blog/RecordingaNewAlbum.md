Riff Raff went into Porcupine Studios in SE London in December to record a new album called "Weightless", to be released in 2024. The sessions included all the new material premiered on the road over the previous few months and written by Dave and Brigitte over the past few years. We're very excited by the results, and can't wait to get it out into the world for everyone to hear.
